It was first developed in order to establish a satellite launch vehicle for Europe. The three-stage rocket developed was named Europa, after the mythical Greek god. Overall, there were 10 launches that occurred under ELDO's funding. The organisation consisted of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Australia was an associate member of the organisation.  Initially, the launch site was in Woomera, Australia, but was later moved to the French site Kourou, in French Guiana. The programme was created to replace the Blue Streak Missile Programme after its cancellation in 1960. In 1974, after an unsuccessful satellite launch, the programme was merged with the European Space Research Organisation to form the European Space Agency.\n","Country?\n","Europe\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Government space agency\n","CNES\n","['CNES', 'CNE', 'Canadian National Exhibition', 'CNE Bandshell', 'Exhibition Place', 'Exhibition Stadium', 'Guiana Space Centre', 'French space program', 'OSTM/Jason-2', 'Patrick Baudry']\n","CNES\n","Country?\n","France\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Government space agency\n","Douglas\n","['Douglas', 'Douglas MacArthur', 'Michael Douglas', 'Douglas fir', 'Buster Douglas', 'Donna Douglas', 'Douglas (cosmetics)', 'McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle', 'Eric Douglas', 'Douglas Adams']\n","Douglas Aircraft Company\n","Country?\n","U.S.A.\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Private spaceflight company\n","EER\n","['EER', 'Seasonal energy efficiency ratio', 'European seasonal energy efficiency ratio', 'Enhanced entity–relationship model', 'Field of Honor (1986 film)', 'Ahasuerus', 'Institute of Medicine Equation', 'Tulipani, Love, Honour and a Bicycle', 'Kaiir Elam', 'Boeing 777']\n","EER Systems Corporation\n","Country?\n","U.S.A.\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Private spaceflight company\n","ESA\n","['European Space Agency', 'ESA (disambiguation)', 'ESA (company)', 'IBM System/390', 'E3', 'ESA Brive', 'Esa Holopainen', 'ESA Television', '2022 European Space Agency Astronaut selection', 'Esa Pakarinen']\n","European Space Agency\n","Country?\n","Europe\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Government space agency\n","Eurockot\n","['Eurockot Launch Services', 'CubeSat', 'Sentinel-5 Precursor', 'Rokot', 'Swarm (spacecraft)', 'SERVIS-2', 'THEOS (satellite)', 'Vega (rocket)', 'Copernicus Programme', 'ArianeGroup']\n","Eurockot Launch Services\n","Country?\n","France\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Private spaceflight company\n","ExPace\n","['ExPace', 'Kuaizhou', 'Galactic Energy', 'OneSpace', 'LinkSpace', 'FedEx', 'LandSpace', 'Comparison of orbital launch systems', 'Jack McKinney (basketball)', 'Launch service provider']\n","ExPace\n","Country?\n","China\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Government space agency\n","Exos\n","['Exos', 'EXOS', 'Exos Aerospace', 'Exokernel', 'Exo', 'Armadillo Aerospace', 'Exo (disambiguation)', 'Nannoscincus exos', \"Exo Planet 2 – The Exo'luxion\", 'XOXO Exo']\n","Exos Aerospace\n","Country?\n","U.S.A.\n","Government space agency or Private spaceflight company?\n","Private spaceflight company\n","Firefly\n","['Firefly', 'Firefly (TV series)', 'Firefly (key exchange protocol)', 'Firefly (disambiguation)', 'Firefly Lane', 'Sherman Firefly', 'Firefly Aerospace', 'Firefly (G.I.
